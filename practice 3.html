    <h2>How to Store Leftovers</h2>
This dish is best served fresh, as the oil tends to separate from the pasta after being refrigerated. It is still just as delicious, however you may need to take an extra step in re-heating if the oil bothers you.

Your leftovers will last 3-5 days in the fridge. To reheat, you can simply microwave it. To reduce the amount of separated oil in your bowl, reheat your leftovers in a skillet over medium-heat with a splash of water. Continually toss the pasta well as it heats up to re-create the sauce.
